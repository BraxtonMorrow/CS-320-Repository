**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
By using progams like Spring Boot and Maven in conjunction you can check dependancies and code for errors or vulnerabilites, however that isn't always enough. Sometimes you need to ensure coding is secure by knowning and memorizing ways that code can be abused and avoiding these mistakes in your code.
**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
By talking to a client, or product owner themselves. By understanding user needs directly you can add functionality that they want into the system. Talking and engaing in communcation is the most important aspect of obtaining information about client needs.
**How do I approach designing software?**
By directly addressing the needs of the client. You are designing the system for them, if it doesn't meet their needs why design it in the first place. By breaking down each piece like a puzzle (each requirement) and then trying to solve it and fit it into the larger overarching complex puzzle that is the main system.
